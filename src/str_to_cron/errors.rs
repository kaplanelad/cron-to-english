//! This module defines error types and handling for the "English to Corn" project.
//!
//! The `Error` enum represents the different kinds of errors that can occur during
//! the processing of input data. Each error variant captures specific details about the error,
//! allowing for more descriptive and accurate error reporting.
//!
//! The module also provides a type alias `Result<T>` for convenience, defaulting to
//! using the `Error` type as the error variant in the `std::result::Result`.
